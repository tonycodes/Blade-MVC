You can also now use Laravel's eloquent ORM to map your models to tables. \r\n\r\nEach model is mapped to the database table its name corresponds to, \r\ne.g this model is called Content so it will map to the table Contents. Notice the S added, you call the model using \r\nits singular expression. Eloquent will do the rest for you. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
